Laboratory-1 tasks.
In this assignment I've solved 10 tasks using recursion algorithms. You can see different recursion functions in every task from "src" package. 
I wrote my code on JAVA using IntelliJ IDEA. In my project you can read different comments based on algorithms and other things.
I did a lot of tests for every program to avoid mistakes. Also I redid the solving of task named "isPrime" after my first attempt, thanks to my teacher,
who prompted me a better way of solving this task.
Note: Almost every algorithm in my code is my own way to solving the problem.
